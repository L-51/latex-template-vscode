You must clone **your fork**, not the main repository.  
Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click **Code**, and copy the URL.  

Clone it using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/latex-vscode-template.git
```
Then change into the project directory:
```bash
cd latex-vscode-template
```

## 3. Create a new branch
Use a descriptive branch name.  
Modern Git recommends using switch:
```bash
  git switch -c new-branch
```
Common branch prefixes:
- `feature/` -> new features or enhancements
- `fix/` -> bug fixes
- `hotfix/` -> urgent fixes
- `docs/` -> documentation updates
For example:
```bash
  git switch -c feature/improve-structure
```

## 4. Make your changes
Modify the necessary files. Make sure:
- The template still compiles correctly
- The documentation remains consistent
- The project structure stays modular
You can check modified files with `git status`.

## 5. Commit your changes
Stage and commit:
<pre>
  git add .
  git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
</pre>
Please write clear and descriptive commit messages.

## 6. Push your branch
Push your branch to your fork:  
```bash
  git push origin new-branch
```
